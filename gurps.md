ER by 2 instead of the default of 1.

#### Restricted Spell Guidance

Below are examples of spells that are not thematic for the setting. Ideas that stray close to any of the spells
enumerated below should be reconsidered or, if attempted, may fail outright.

* Food Spells - Magic. pg. 79.

## Syntactic Magic of Abseta

### Tally and Threshold

Thaumatology pg. 76

Magic does not have an energy cost. Instead, magic has a power tally that must be tracked by the magic user.

* All mages start with a power tally threshold of 30.
* Mages recover their power tally threshold at 10 points per-day.
* Persistent magic effects add to a caster's power tally.
    * Always on magic items
    * Magic effects maintained by a caster
    * Magic effects with a time direction created by a caster
* Non-persistent magic items add to the caster's power tally but only when activated.
    * Similarly, raw schemas (written Symbolic Magic) also only add to the caster's power tally when activated.

#### Enduring a Correction

| Tally Over Threshold | Correction Strength |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 0 - 4                | +1                  |
| 5 - 9                | +2                  |
| 10 - 14              | +3                  |
| 15 - 19              | +5                  |
| 20 - 24              | +8                  |
| 25 - 29              | +13                 |
| 30 - 34              | +21                 |
| 35 - 39              | +34                 |
| 40+                  | ...                 |

### Restricted Effects

## Symbolic Magic of Abseta

Symbolic magic in Abseta uses the same nouns and verbs defined in the Syntactic Magic Lexicon.

#### Optional Rules

* Margin of Success for Syntactic Parameters - Thaumatology pg. 180+
* Parchment Symbol Casting - Thaumatology pg. 173
    * Symbols and Dust - Thaumatology pg. 175

### Schematic Device Invocation

Caster must have Symbol Writing. Rules for invocation follow activating symbolic magic - Thaumatology pg. 173.

### Symbol Verbs

All symbol verbs retain their respective energy cost as defined in the Syntactic Magic Lexicon. Casters only need the
relevant skill for a verb once.

### Symbol Nouns

All symbol nouns retain their respective energy cost as defined in the Syntactic Magic Lexicon. Casters only need the
relevant skill for a noun once.

### Schematic Writing and Enchantment

Enchantment, known in-settings as "Schema Embedding" is the most common form of device proliferation and utilization.

Enchantment in Abseta uses the Symbolic Enchantment rules found in - Thaumatology pg. 175

* Magic Items - Basic pg. 480+
* See Enchantment - Magic pg. 18
* Enchantment Spells - Magic pg. 58
* Symbol Magic - Magic pg. 207.

#### Calculating Magic Item Energy Cost Using Symbolics

Calculate the tally point cost for the symbol effect – as per Energy Cost (Thaumatology pg. 175) – and then multiply
this by 250 for the enchanting energy cost. Restrictions can modify this in similar ways to spell-based enchantments
limited by spells such as Bane. For example, for a sword enchanted so that its magic only works against giants, divide
energy cost by 3 and then increase it by 100.

##### Example: Energy Reserve Storage

Energy reserve storage requires two symbols: `Meta` and `Transform`. Taking into account the relevant multipliers this
comes out to: `Meta (Tally Point Cost 2)` * `Transform (Tally Point Cost 2)` * `250` = `1000 Energy Cost`.

#### Additional Enchanting Rule References

* Quick and Dirty - Basic pg. 481
* Slow and Sure - Basic pg. 481
* Enchanters must use the [Meta](#meta) noun as part of the enchantment to represent Power - Basic pg. 481.

## Verbs

Verbs are required in a phrase to impart action. Without a verb, a phrase has no effect.

### Create

Can be used to invoke creation of a given set of nouns. This creation may take many shapes depending on the nouns
involved and can manifest from nothing.

### Restore

The restore verb implies a reversal of entropy in a given set of nouns. Has synonymous meaning with repair in many
phrases.

#### Move

Move gives directional motion at any scale to a given set of nouns.

The move verb is suitable for short-term effects only. Its simplicity is both a boon and a detriment when it comes to
creating more complicated devices. Devices effects with a longer duration must include `Strengthen` as an additional
verb.

#### Protect

Protect can be used with a given set of nouns to imply resistance.

#### Transform

Transform is used synonymously with changing and conversion. Could be used to describe energy transference.

#### Strengthen

Strengthen is synonymous with both amplification and fortification.

#### Weaken

Antipode of strengthen. To make vulnerable. To dampen.
