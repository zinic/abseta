Magic does not have an energy cost. Instead, magic has a power tally that must be tracked by the magic user.

* Persistent magic effects add to a caster's power tally.
    * Always on magic items
    * Magic effects maintained by a caster
    * Magic effects with a time direction created by a caster
* Non-persistent magic items add to the caster's power tally but only when activated.
    * Similarly, raw schemas (written Symbolic Magic) also only add to the caster's power tally when activated.
