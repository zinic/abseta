ER by 2 instead of the default of 1.

Enchantment, known in-settings as "Schema Embedding" is the most common form of device proliferation and utilization.

* See Enchantment - Magic pg. 18
* Symbol Magic - Magic pg. 207.

#### Restricted Spell Guidance

Below are examples of spells that are not thematic for the setting. Ideas that stray close to any of the spells
enumerated below should be reconsidered or, if attempted, may fail outright.

* Food Spells - Magic. pg. 79.
* Illusion Spells - Magic pg. 97.
* Body Control Spells - Magic pg. 37.
* Technological Spells - Magic pg. 177.

#### Exceptions for Larger Group of Conductors

* Creation Spells are too complex to be practical by a single magic user.
    * Exceptions for large groups of schema writers (1,000+) with high difficulty.
    * Exceptions for large groups show diminishing returns after scaling up to roughly 10,000 schema writers.
    * Effects remain simple for current era.

## Syntactic Magic of Abseta

### Tally and Threshold

Thaumatology pg. 76

Magic does not have an energy cost. Instead, magic has a power tally that must be tracked by the magic user.

* All mages start with a power tally threshold of 30.
* Mages recover their power tally threshold at 10 points per-day.
* Magic items add to the caster's power tally but only when activated.
    * Similarly, raw schemas (written Symbolic Magic) also only add to the caster's power tally when activated.

#### Enduring a Correction

| Tally Over Threshold | Correction Strength |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 0 - 9                | +1                  |
