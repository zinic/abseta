# Setting

Abseta is a small universe that exists within a simulation.

## Universal Properties

Solar passes of Abdica since simulation inception: `10,129 passes`.

### The Substrate

Very few living beings are aware of the substrate. Even fewer understand what it is. Those aware of the substrate may
find far greater success in creating magical devices and scripts.

### Primary Plane

The Abdica primary plane consists of four components:

#### Abseta

(*Ab - seh - tah*)

Also known as **The Void**.

A pocket of three-dimensional space that contains Metricos, Abdica and Ruia. The Void has never been mapped formally.

#### Metricos

(*Meh - tree - kos*)

A main-stage, medium-sized star found at the center of The Void.

#### Abdica

(*Ab - di - ka*)

A planetoid that contains enough mass to exhibit positive gravity and sustain geological dynamics.

#### Ruia

(*Ruu - ee - ah*)

Abdica's only moon.

### Universe Size

The universe contains no other celestial entities beyond The Void.

### Fundamental physical forces:

* Gravitational
* Electromagnetic
* Strong Force
* Weak Force

## Population

Abdica is home to roughly 600 million agents.

## Cultures

Abdica contains a diverse array of agent cultures and species.

### Agent Species

## History

Abdica contains roughly 10,000 years of historical information that has been passed down by various species that exist
within the Primary Plane.

### Previous Eras

#### The First Era

#### The Uplift

#### First Downfall

#### The Long Dark

#### Assembly Era

called the common era calendar.

Solar passes recognized by the common era calendar: `629 passes`.
