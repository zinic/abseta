Abseta is a small universe that exists within a simulation. The progenitors of the substrate are unknown.

## Universal Properties

Solar passes of Abdica since simulation inception: `10,129 passes`.

### The Substrate

Very few living beings are aware of the substrate. Even fewer understand what it is. Those aware of the substrate may
find far greater success in creating magical devices and scripts.

### Primary Plane

The Abdica primary plane consists of four components:

#### Abseta

(*Ab - seh - tah*)

Also known as **The Void**.

A pocket of three-dimensional space that contains Metricos, Abdica and Ruia. The Void has never been mapped formally.

#### Metricos

(*Meh - tree - kos*)

A main-stage, medium-sized star found at the center of The Void.

#### Abdica

(*Ab - di - ka*)

A planetoid that contains enough mass to exhibit positive gravity and sustain geological dynamics.

#### Ruia

(*Ruu - ee - ah*)

Abdica's only moon.

### Universe Size

The universe contains no other celestial entities beyond The Void.

### Fundamental physical forces:

* Gravitational
* Electromagnetic
* Strong Force
* Weak Force

## Population

Abdica is home to roughly 600 million agents.

## Oceans of Abdica

### Ortu

## Lands of Abdica

Abdica comprises three continents separated by surface oceans.

### Thealia

*(Thee-ahlee-ah)*

* The Twilight Lands.
* Home of the Moralian Abdica Conductor Council.
* Population as of pass 629: `210 million`.

Once known as Therai, Thealia is the smallest of the three main landmasses. Thealia covers much of the North Pole of
Abdica.

#### Black Sand Desert

A desert of black sand situated in the rain shadow of the Hulut mountain range.

### Cortu Amas

*(Coor - too Ah-mahss)*

* The Refuge.
* Population as of pass 629: `360 million`.

The second-largest main landmass of Abdica. Cortu Amas exists in the most habitable latitude of Abdica and is
therefore home to most agents.

### Faena

*(Fae - na)*

* The Silent Continent.
* Original cradle of civilization.
* Population as of pass 629: `35 million`.

Faena, the largest landmass of Abdica has been known colloquially as the silent continent since the end of the First
Era. Home to mostly hostile and inhospitable lands, the vast majority of agents inhabiting Faena live along the western
costs that face Cortu Amas across the Ortu ocean. While once a lush and prosperous home, the majority of Faena's surface
landmass is covered by scarring and horrific corrections made during the First Collapse.

### Agent Species

## History

Abdica contains roughly 10,000 years of historical information that has been passed down by various species that exist
within the Primary Plane.

## Previous Eras

### Prehistory

0sp - 3800sp

#### Noteworthy Agents

* Cortu Azalean
* Amas Altu
* Thorza Altu

##### First Devices

Cave people learn how to control fire with timed pelvic thrusts.

##### Rise of Trade Guilds

Cave people now pelvic thrust on boats to trade goods with others.

##### Discovery of Scriptwriting

Scriptwriting become well known to society in the later 1000 passes of the prehistoric era. It's estimated that sometime
between 2800 sp and 3800 sp society all prominent cultures on Abdica produced writing systems for both natural language
and script runes. Many cultures, having shared nothing during this era, produced highly compatible written systems for
their natural languages.

This convergence of written languages is known as the "scriptwriters' fingerprint." Device script must be written a very
specific way. Every stroke, its order, the position of the runes had meaning. All device scripts, no matter the source
culture are written using the same syntax as well. It's assumed that discovery of device script came before the
development of natural language writing systems for all cultures that demonstrate convergence.

Not all writing systems are common, however. There were many cultures that developed natural language writing first.
However, by the beginning of the First Era, nearly every culture involved in trade with others had adopted the common
natural language writing system derived from device script.

##### Societal Regulation of Devices

Devices of significant complexity are difficult to learn and even more difficult to invoke. As such, it was highly
unlikely that a device used by an agent would necessitate a device correction. The introduction of scriptwriting allowed
early controllers the capacity needed to express far more complex device designs. More complex designs inevitably lead
to device corrections.

Scriptwriting was considered a punishable act for anyone but the most venerated and wisest of the tribes due to this
new danger. Despite societal trepidation toward scriptwriting the advances that could come from it were too enticing. It
wasn't uncommon for controllers to die while attempting to perfect a new script. Some device corrections of this era
are documented from recovered script artifacts that show obvious defects in their design.

### The First Era

3800sp - 4224sp

#### Noteworthy Agents

* Elma Sarumir

##### First Correction

The history of the First Era is filled with runaway devices and their resulting corrections. Toward the end of the First
Age much of the surface of Abdica had been scarred by corrections ranging from the loss of a single home or land plot
all the way up to entire towns. No matter the danger of correction, civilization refused to temper its appetite for more
complex and potent devices.

Development of scripts necessitated the need for novel writing systems around 4000 sp. This enabled cultures to create
and invoke far more intricate devices than ages prior.

##### Ortu Cabal

To wrangle potential correction fallout from this new class of complex devices, the most adept controllers from around
Abdica congregate in Haluid the capital city of the Akama of Cortu Amas.

This leads to a centralization of control of devices that spans all major land masses and cultures called the Ortu
Cabal. This cabal of device invokers and scriptwriters sought to control both the usage and proliferation of complex
devices. A secret and tightly guarded goal of the cabal was also to study how the physics of device corrections
operate.

The Ortu Cabal operated safely for roughly 200 passes, bringing to civilization great advances in both devices and
technology. During the beginning for 4120 sp a routine test into correction physics was undertaken by a sect of the Ortu
Cabal located in central Therai (presently Thealia) in a city called Osukla.

Situated at the base of the Hulut range, Osukla benefited from its rather remote location as it was the only bastion of
civilization and trade that existed along the edge of the Black Sand Desert. Osukla relied heavily on advanced devices
and scripts to maintain its presence due to a lack of easily accessible fresh water.

The correction experiment had been carried out by the Ortu Cabal regularly for years without significant issue. This
test however was destined to be ill-fated. Spurred by advances in script complexity, several of the Ortu controllers
present Vakuliya college had modified the parameters of the test in novel ways to explore attempts to contain or
otherwise limit a device correction.

The novel components of the test collapsed inward on and rapidly devolved into a runaway device the size of which had
yet to exist on Abdica. The outpouring of reality distorting energies from the resulting correction shattered the Hulut
mountain range. Worse still, the geological disturbance shattered a stable magma dome, leading to an eruption of the
largest land feature in the range closest to the epicenter of the device correction.

Both Osukla and Vakuliya college were wiped by the ensuing flood of magma and pyroclastic clouds. Thousands perished in
mere hours and few survivors escaped the wrath of the device correction. The area near Osukla was rapidly abandoned with
the newly christened Hulut volcano showing no signs of slowing. It would erupt slowly over the coming decades, rendering
one of the few relatively habitable locations of the Black Desert otherwise uninhabitable.

##### Abandonment of Scriptwriting

In response to the events at Osukla, fearful that this kind of power could spiral out of control of the Ortu Cabal, they
began a secret campaign against any well known controllers within their political reach. The controllers that joined the
Ortu were spared and forced to secrecy about scriptwriting. Those that refused to yield to the Ortu were killed at best
and enslaved at worst.

Devices become more primitive over the coming century with no one to author new scripts. Most operators are still
effective despite many nation states outright banning device use without some kind of license or registration for the
purposes of alerting the Ortu.

Device and technological advances slow while the Ortu devolves into splintered groups. In the remaining century or so
before the beginning of the uplift, several Ortu derivatives begin to consolidate power more openly. Instead of waging
wars, these new public faces of the ancient order take over manufacturing and trade. They use this immense concentration
of economic power to assert their political will.

### The Uplift

4224sp - 5350sp

#### Noteworthy Agents

* Kami Ritus

#### Noteworthy Events

#### The First Schematic

The first schematic was a geological device designed to halt the Hulut volcano. The active volcano was chosen due to the
remote and uninhabited nature of its location. The experiment was lead by Kami Ritus, a Therai guild conductor. It was
said that Kemas had a savant-like ability when it came to creating devices of staggering complexity.

The schematic was stored in two large scrolls that together would require four individuals to open due to their length.
It was Kami's job to invoke the schema laid before her at the base of the volcano. Upon invocation, the heat of the
volcano bled from the rock and earth below. Frost quickly gathered on the rim of the volcano's cone. Within minutes the
constant churning of the magma below had been quelled.

#### Inception of the Uplifted Trade Guilds

Driven by more and more applications for larger and more complex schemas, conductors from the four major factions build
small empires for themselves modeled after the trade guilds from the ill-fated first age.

##### Therai Guild

Prior to the inception of the uplifted trade guilds, the Therai had already made a name for themselves as an adaptable
culture adept at moving and procuring information. They were one of the first cultures to resume the "old ways." The
Therai have dedicated their existence to deciphering ancient scripts recovered from the first age. In many aspects the
Therai are the most advanced of the four guilds that rose to dominance during the uplift.

##### Tor Guild

The Tor guild comprises a conglomerate of smaller trade companies that operate in cooperation. The Tor were late to
developing more advanced devices and schematics. As such they spend much of the end of the first age in pursuit of
expanding their manufacturing capacity.

##### Metricos Guild

Worshipers of Metricos.

Lots of research into devices designed to aid in the growth of food crops. Due to the dominance of the other
guilds, the Metricos relinquished their paltry presence to focus on device designs. Despite leaving the trade domain,
the Metricos ship more cargo across the Ortu than any other guild. As such they have maintained much of their political
power while exiting the power struggle maintained between the other three.

##### The Mal Ortu

The weirdos and whiz kids. Stupid crazy schemas. Reclusive.

#### Noteworthy Events

* Raid of Torvokos
* Therai Correction Plot
* The Therai War
* The First Collapse

#### Raid of Torvokos

The rise of Therai designs and advances during this era is directly tied to the completion of one of the largest design
colleges: Torvokos. The college was erected along the outskirts of a sister town named Thrask in the central lowlands of
Cortu Amas.

Late in the 5348th solar pass a group of 30, expertly trained, military controllers raided the college late at night.
All academics in the college were quickly slaughtered. Those with expertise in designs were longer lived but no match
for the raiders. The buildings of the college were pillaged of anything of or relating to in-progress scripts and
schematics.

Investigations into the raid pointed originally to agents of The Mal Ortu but there remained no direct evidence that
could otherwise identify the perpetrators. The next advancement in the investigation wasn't until roughly a year after a
new advancement in Tor production capacity was traced back to a stolen schematic from Torvokos. Still unable to prove
further connection, this realization lead to public scandal and accusations left unresolved.

The primary result of the public nature of the fallout was a lingering and potent hatred of the Tor guild amongst the
Therai leaders. It would be decades before this festering wound would lead to a seething for revenge too strong to
ignore any longer.

Although the college was recovered and returned to its prior state after a 10 year-long restoration, Torvokos never
returned to his previous height as a venerated academic establishment.

#### The Therai Correction Plot

The Tor guild is now a well established ocean trade venture that has become the defacto means of transportation across
the Ortu ocean. While last of the four guilds to begin their own research into more advanced devices instead of
purchasing them this allowed the Tor to pick ideas from the best implementations already in use. Many of their advances
increased the speed and efficiency of their production and transport capacity. The Tor's rise in trade dominance came at
the cost of their long-time rival, the Therai guild.

Transgressions from the Uplift Era and the loss of the Therai guild's competitiveness in trade and transit operations
lead to the eventual creation of the Correction Plot. This subversive plan was concocted in the highest echelon to
cripple one of the largest ports along the coast of Faena. The objective was to use a Mal Ortu contracted ship to sail
one of the Therai's most dedicated conductors to Tol Amas.

Upon arrival, the conductor descended below decks to the cargo hold. Stored therein was a schematic designed to spiral
out of control. The effects would be imperceptible at first as the device directed immense amounts of thermal energy
into the water of the harbor. The water around the ship would begin to boil first. As the invoked device grew in power
the coastline of the harbor city became enveloped by a cloud of superheated steam. Those closest to the coastline not
sheltered from the cloud all perished within minutes.

Water from the surrounding ocean poured in to fill the rapidly evaporating harbor. The wooden components of any harbor
structure would catch fire next. This spread outward from the harbor and into the rest of the city, torching any
flammable material while heating stone till it glowed. Those sheltered were roasted and burnt alive, leaving residents a
grim choice between two gruesome deaths.

The device burned outward at a staggering rate over the course of several hours. With most of the city already consumed
by the intense heat there were no survivors remaining inside the city to witness the correction triggered by the out of
control device. The resulting split of reality flattened a radius around the device's epicenter several miles in radius.
Records of the event only exist from the perspective of far away ships watching as the city burned from a distance.

#### The Therai War

Despite the fact that there remained no evidence of what had happened to Tol Amas, the Tor held such sway that even if
the Therai had not been responsible, the blame would still have found them. The Therai's willingness to use device
correction as a weapon galvanized the other three guilds in opposition. It had been more than a thousand years since
Abdican civilizations had witnessed a correction of this magnitude. The Tor demanded no less than two thirds of the
Therai guild's assets in reparation.

The Tor delegation and proposal was met with open hostility and was unsuccessful in procuring a resolution. Pressure
from the Metricos and the Mal Ortu was also ineffective in swaying the entrenched Therai leaders. Given the
unwillingness of the Therai to capitulate, a guild war was inevitable.

Being one of the lesser of the four guilds, the Therai can not project enough force to effectively fight a war across
the Ortu ocean. They instead double down on previous strategies. Correction effects are seen as their ultimate weapon. A
correction large enough could end the war.

The entire Therai fleet departs for Faena. Tor and Metricos guild controllers aboard vessels in a combined united guild
fleet route the Therai with overwhelming force. The pressure applied by the larger fleet forces the Therai fleet to
divert in retreat.

The pursing united guild fleet forces the Therai to commit to the nearest Faenan coast. Unknown to the Therai, the
geographic area was selected intentionally by the united guild fleet. Prepared, not far from the coastline, was a
massive and already active device. With the Therai fleet and landing detachment effectively pinned they commit to
execute the correction generating schematic. The enormous device quickly begins to spiral out of control.

The Mal Ortu activate their nearby counter-device in response. The goal of the counter-device is to force the spiral to
invoke a correction sooner rather than later to limit the radius of damage. However, the effect required to halt the
Therai schematic is greater than any Mal Ortu academic expectation.

Instead of halting, the spiral of schematic effects compound. Tendrils of eerie violet energy arced across the scorched
landscape, seeming to erupt from the ground itself. These immense threads of reality bending light stretched out across
thousands of miles of Faena heartland to redirect and halt the combined device. The release of energy is so strong that
it rips Faena up. Millions perish. Land becomes forever irradiated or otherwise tainted. Thousands of tons of fallout
spew upwards into the sky from the mile deep trenches carved into the once verdant ground.

The remaining forces of the united guilds topple the Therai and take over the guild house in their home city of Kokoria.
This ends the lineage for the Therai guild and results in total occupation of Therai itself. The remaining Therai
conductors are exiled and forced to live on a remote island in the Ortu Ocean.

#### The Long Dark

Darkness blots out the sun for months. Weather pattern disruptions occur across all of Abdica. The climate changes as
the fallout settles, altering the environment of the entire simulation. The effects of the correction continue to ripple
outwards for years. The historical impact of this resulting era remains a cultural constant throughout all future ages.
The Long Dark is the name given to the period of time spanning several years following the destruction of Faena. During
this era the effects of the correction continue to alter the physical geography of the world in drastic ways.

The Mal Ortu and Metricos carve between them a given a portion of Therai to administer. The new order of the guilds was
largely divided up by the location of the cities they controlled. In an exchange of land and political favor, The Mal
Ortu are gifted with the entirety of the guild house in Kokoria.

Within months of the war, the guilds launch the first of many large scale projects. A massive fleet of ships and other
vessels are constructed to replace the fleets destroyed in the war. The project is conducted under the auspices of the
Mal Ortu Guild Reconstruction Council. Within a few years, the fleet is completed and begins its work of reestablishing
trade routes.

With the fleet in place, trade once again flourishes. The Faenan coasts finally begin revitalization efforts. The
weakend Tor guild survives but is relegated to a place far behind the Mal Ortu and the Metricos.

The fallout from the Therai war shows signs of clearing after 9 years. With in 12 the aberrant weather patterns
normalize, making ocean transit far easier and less dangerous.

## Deities of Abseta

Throughout the ages of Abseta there have been many deities worshiped. Some of these deities are indeed real collections
of interrelated devices. These devices are of sufficient complexity which allows them to maintain a collective presence
within the immaterial state of the substrate.

Like devices and inactive agents, deities exist on the razor's edge within the substrate's state. All deities are
reactive. They are not agents. Devices, scripts and schematics up to the Current Era all lack the necessary complexity
to achieve any form of agency. As such, deities are more akin to a library of devices that can be accessed or otherwise
invoked with another device. These are called invocation devices and are often represented in some form of religious
worship or ritual.

Deities in Abseta are often viewed as sources of power. While some religions will impose agency and personality onto the
devices that make up a deity, the reality is that the devices have no feelings or desires and only encapsulate
functionality to be maintained and accessed. This means that followers of a deity will never have a conversation with
them. Deities "express" their presence and expose their power through religious invocation of their followers.

### The Decay

Due to the volatility of the substrate, many deities throughout history have been reclaimed. In religious circles this
inevitability is known as The Decay.

Deification requires a certain amount of stability in the devices that the deity exists in. Devices may contain
self-correcting functionality or an active base of worshipers may work tirelessly to maintain the deified devices.
Despite this, no worshiped deity has been able to indefinitely stave off inactivation due to the reclamation and
optimization functions of the substrate.
