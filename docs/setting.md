# Setting

Abseta is a small universe that exists within a simulation. The progenitors of the substrate are unknown.

## Universal Properties

Solar passes of Abdica since simulation inception: `10,129 passes`.

### The Substrate

Very few living beings are aware of the substrate. Even fewer understand what it is. Those aware of the substrate may
find far greater success in creating magical devices and scripts.

### Primary Plane

The Abdica primary plane consists of four components:

#### Abseta

(*Ab - seh - tah*)

Also known as **The Void**.

A pocket of three-dimensional space that contains Metricos, Abdica and Ruia. The Void has never been mapped formally.

#### Metricos

(*Meh - tree - kos*)

A main-stage, medium-sized star found at the center of The Void.

#### Abdica

(*Ab - di - ka*)

A planetoid that contains enough mass to exhibit positive gravity and sustain geological dynamics.

#### Ruia

(*Ruu - ee - ah*)

Abdica's only moon.

### Universe Size

The universe contains no other celestial entities beyond The Void.

### Fundamental physical forces:

* Gravitational
* Electromagnetic
* Strong Force
* Weak Force

## Population

Abdica is home to roughly 600 million agents.

## Oceans of Abdica

### Ortu

## Lands of Abdica

Abdica comprises three continents separated by surface oceans.

### Thealia

*(Thee-ahlee-ah)*

* The Twilight Lands.
* Home of the Moralian Abdica Conductor Council.
* Population as of pass 629: `210 million`.

Once known as Therai, Thealia is the smallest of the three main landmasses. Thealia covers much of the North Pole of
Abdica.

### Cortu Amas

*(Coor - too Ah-mahss)*

* The Refuge.
* Population as of pass 629: `360 million`.

The second-largest main landmass of Abdica. Cortu Amas exists in the most habitable latitude of Abdica and is
therefore home to most agents.

### Faena

*(Fae - na)*

* The Silent Continent.
* Original cradle of civilization.
* Population as of pass 629: `35 million`.

Faena, the largest landmass of Abdica has been known colloquially as the silent continent since the end of the First
Era. Home to mostly hostile and inhospitable lands, the vast majority of agents inhabiting Faena live along the western
costs that face Cortu Amas across the Ortu ocean. While once a lush and prosperous home, the majority of Faena's surface
landmass is covered by scarring and horrific corrections made during the First Collapse.

## Cultures

Abdica contains a diverse array of agent cultures and species.

## History

Abdica contains roughly 10,000 years of historical information that has been passed down by various species that exist
within the Primary Plane.

### Current Era

The current era is known as the era of convergence. It is a time of stable prosperity brought about after recovery from
the second ruin.

Most cultures on Abdica recognize a common calendar that came into use after the second downfall. This calendar is
called the common era calendar.

Solar passes recognized by the common era calendar: `629 passes`.

## Deities of Abseta

Throughout the ages of Abseta there have been many deities worshiped. Some of these deities are indeed real collections
of interrelated devices. These devices are of sufficient complexity which allows them to maintain a collective presence
within the immaterial state of the substrate.

Like devices and inactive agents, deities exist on the razor's edge within the substrate's state. All deities are
reactive. They are not agents. Devices, scripts and schematics up to the Current Era all lack the necessary complexity
to achieve any form of agency. As such, deities are more akin to a library of devices that can be accessed or otherwise
invoked with another device. These are called invocation devices and are often represented in some form of religious
worship or ritual.

Deities in Abseta are often viewed as sources of power. While some religions will impose agency and personality onto the
devices that make up a deity, the reality is that the devices have no feelings or desires and only encapsulate
functionality to be maintained and accessed. This means that followers of a deity will never have a conversation with
them. Deities "express" their presence and expose their power through religious invocation of their followers.

### Historical Deities

### Current Era Deities

### The Decay

Due to the volatility of the substrate, many deities throughout history have been reclaimed. In religious circles this
inevitability is known as The Decay.

Deification requires a certain amount of stability in the devices that the deity exists in. Devices may contain
self-correcting functionality or an active base of worshipers may work tirelessly to maintain the deified devices.
Despite this, no worshiped deity has been able to indefinitely stave off inactivation due to the reclamation and
optimization functions of the substrate.
