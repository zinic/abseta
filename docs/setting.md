# Setting

Abseta is a small universe that exists within a simulation. The progenitors of the substrate are unknown.

## Universal Properties

Solar passes of Abdica since simulation inception: `10,129 passes`.

### The Substrate

Very few living beings are aware of the substrate. Even fewer understand what it is. Those aware of the substrate may
find far greater success in creating magical devices and scripts.

### Primary Plane

The Abdica primary plane consists of four components:

#### Abseta

(*Ab - seh - tah*)

Also known as **The Void**.

A pocket of three-dimensional space that contains Metricos, Abdica and Ruia. The Void has never been mapped formally.

#### Metricos

(*Meh - tree - kos*)

A main-stage, medium-sized star found at the center of The Void.

#### Abdica

(*Ab - di - ka*)

A planetoid that contains enough mass to exhibit positive gravity and sustain geological dynamics.

#### Ruia

(*Ruu - ee - ah*)

Abdica's only moon.

### Universe Size

The universe contains no other celestial entities beyond The Void.

### Fundamental physical forces:

* Gravitational
* Electromagnetic
* Strong Force
* Weak Force

## Population

Abdica is home to roughly 600 million agents.

## Oceans of Abdica

### Ortu

## Lands of Abdica

Abdica comprises three continents separated by surface oceans.

### Thealia

*(Thee-ahlee-ah)*

* The Twilight Lands.
* Home of the Moralian Abdica Conductor Council.
* Population as of pass 629: `210 million`.

Once known as Therai, Thealia is the smallest of the three main landmasses. Thealia covers much of the North Pole of
Abdica.

### Cortu Amas

*(Coor - too Ah-mahss)*

* The Refuge.
* Population as of pass 629: `360 million`.

The second-largest main landmass of Abdica. Cortu Amas exists in the most habitable latitude of Abdica and is
therefore home to most agents.

### Faena

*(Fae - na)*

* The Silent Continent.
* Original cradle of civilization.
* Population as of pass 629: `35 million`.

Faena, the largest landmass of Abdica has been known colloquially as the silent continent since the end of the First
Era. Home to mostly hostile and inhospitable lands, the vast majority of agents inhabiting Faena live along the western
costs that face Cortu Amas across the Ortu ocean. While once a lush and prosperous home, the majority of Faena's surface
landmass is covered by scarring and horrific corrections made during the First Collapse.

## Cultures

Abdica contains a diverse array of agent cultures and species.

## History

Abdica contains roughly 10,000 years of historical information that has been passed down by various species that exist
within the Primary Plane.

### The Uplift

4200sp - 5350sp

#### Noteworthy Agents

#### Noteworthy Events

#### The First Schematic

The first schematic was a geological device designed to halt the Hulut volcano. The active volcano was chosen due to the
remote and uninhabited nature of its location. The experiment was lead by Kami Ritus, a Therai guild conductor. It was
said that Kemas had a savant-like ability when it came to creating devices of staggering complexity.

The schematic was stored in two large scrolls that together would require four individuals to open due to their length.
It was Kami's job to invoke the schema laid before her at the base of the volcano. Upon invocation, the heat of the
volcano bled from the rock and earth below. Frost quickly gathered on the rim of the volcano's cone. Within minutes the
constant churning of the magma below had been quelled.

#### Inception of the Uplifted Trade Guilds

Driven by more and more applications for larger and more complex schemas, conductors from the four major factions build
small empires for themselves modeled after the trade guilds from the ill-fated first age.

##### Therai Guild

Prior to the inception of the uplifted trade guilds, the Therai had already made a name for themselves as an adaptable
culture adept at moving and procuring information. They were one of the first cultures to resume the old ways. Spending
a great deal of time deciphering ancient scripts recovered from the first age.

##### Tor Guild

The Tor guild comprises a conglomerate of smaller trade companies that operate in cooperation. The Tor were late to
developing more advanced devices and schematics. As such they spend much of the end of the first age in pursuit of
expanding their manufacturing capacity.

##### Metricos Guild

Worshipers of Metricos.

Lots of research into devices designed to aid in the growth of food crops. Due to the dominance of the other
guilds, the Metricos relinquished their paltry presence to focus on device designs. Despite leaving the trade domain,
the Metricos ship more cargo across the Ortu than any other guild. As such they have maintained much of their political
power while exiting the power struggle maintained between the other three.

##### The Mal Ortu

The weirdos and whiz kids. Stupid crazy schemas. Reclusive.

### First Collapse

5348sp - 5451sp

#### Noteworthy Agents

* Amiara Thera
* Polsen Tor

#### Noteworthy Events

* The Therai Correction Plot
* The Therai War
* The First Collapse

#### Raid of Torvokos

The rise of Therai designs and advances during this era is directly tied to the completion of one of the largest design
colleges: Torvokos. The college was erected along the outskirts of a sister town named Thrask in the central lowlands of
Cortu Amas.

Late in the 5348th solar pass a group of 30, expertly trained, military controllers raided the college late at night.
All academics in the college were quickly slaughtered. Those with expertise in designs were longer lived but no match
for the raiders. The buildings of the college were pillaged of anything of or relating to in-progress scripts and
schematics.

Investigations into the raid pointed originally to agents of The Mal Ortu but there remained no direct evidence that
could otherwise identify the perpetrators. The next advancement in the investigation wasn't until roughly a year after
a new advancement in Tor production capacity was traced back to a stolen schematic from Torvokos. Still unable to prove
further connection, this realization lead to public scandal and accusations left unresolved.

The primary result of the public nature of the fallout was a lingering and potent hatred of the Tor guild amongst the
Therai leaders. It would be decades before this festering wound would lead to a seething for revenge too strong to
ignore any longer.

Although the college was recovered and returned to its prior state after a 10 year-long restoration, Torvokos never
returned to his previous height as a venerated academic establishment.

#### The Therai Correction Plot

The Tor guild is now a well established ocean trade venture that has become the defacto means of transportation across
the Ortu ocean. While last of the four guilds to begin their own research into more advanced devices instead of
purchasing them this allowed the Tor to pick ideas from the best implementations already in use. Many of their advances
increased the speed and efficiency of their production and transport capacity. The Tor's rise in trade dominance came at
the cost of their long-time rival, the Therai guild.

Transgressions from the Uplift Era and the loss of the Therai guild's competitiveness in trade and transit operations
lead to the eventual creation of the Correction Plot. This subversive plan was concocted in the highest echelon to
cripple one of the largest ports along the coast of Faena. The objective was to use a Mal Ortu contracted ship to sail
one of the Therai's most dedicated conductors to Tol Amas.

Upon arrival, the conductor descended below decks to the cargo hold. Stored therein was a schematic designed to spiral
out of control. The effects would be imperceptible at first as the device directed immense amounts of thermal energy
into the water of the harbor. The water around the ship would begin to boil first. As the invoked device grew in power
the coastline of the harbor city became enveloped by a cloud of superheated steam. Those closest to the coastline
not sheltered from the cloud all perished within minutes.

Water from the surrounding ocean poured in to fill the rapidly evaporating harbor. The wooden components of any harbor
structure would catch fire next. This spread outward from the harbor and into the rest of the city, torching any
flammable material while heating stone till it glowed. Those sheltered were roasted and burnt alive, leaving residents a
grim choice between two gruesome deaths.

The device burned outward at a staggering rate over the course of several hours. With most of the city already consumed
by the intense heat there were no survivors remaining inside the city to witness the correction triggered by the out of
control device. The resulting split of reality flattened a radius around the device's epicenter several miles in radius.
Records of the event only exist from the perspective of far away ships watching as the city burned from a distance.

#### The Therai War

Despite the fact that there remained no evidence of what had happened to Tol Amas, the Tor held such sway that even if
the Therai had not been responsible, the blame would still have found them. The Therai's willingness to use device
correction as a weapon galvanized the other three guilds in opposition. It had been more than a thousand years since
Abdica civilizations had witnessed a correction of this magnitude. The Tor demanded no less than two thirds of the
Therai guild's assets in reparation.

Pressure from the Metricos and the Mal Ortu was ineffective in swaying the entrenched Therai leaders. It was no secret
given the unwillingness of the Therai to capitulate that war would be inevitable.

The Therai use the big boom but are routed by Tor and Metricos guild controllers. They are tricked by The Mal Ortu to
commit to a location that has an already active device and then pin the Therai detachment. Set a month before the
Therai's arrival the Mal Ortu device interacts with the invocation of the Therai correction schematic, fatally. Before
the inevitable correction, a radius measured in hundreds of miles is bathed in heat so intense that entire forrests are
reduced to ash.

The resulting correction required to stop the spiral was greater than any academic expectation. Tendrils of eerie violet
energy arced across the scorched landscape, seeming to erupt from the ground itself. These immense threads of reality
bending light stretched out across thousands of miles of Faena heartland to redirect and halt the combined device. The
release of energy is so strong that it rips Faena up. Millions perish. Land becomes forever irradiated or otherwise
tainted. Thousands of tons of fallout spew upwards into the sky from the mile deep trenches carved into the once verdant
ground.

The remaining forces of the united guilds topple the Therai and take over the guild house in their home city of Kokoria.
This ends the lineage for the Therai guild.

called the common era calendar.

Solar passes recognized by the common era calendar: `629 passes`.

## Deities of Abseta

Throughout the ages of Abseta there have been many deities worshiped. Some of these deities are indeed real collections
of interrelated devices. These devices are of sufficient complexity which allows them to maintain a collective presence
within the immaterial state of the substrate.

Like devices and inactive agents, deities exist on the razor's edge within the substrate's state. All deities are
reactive. They are not agents. Devices, scripts and schematics up to the Current Era all lack the necessary complexity
to achieve any form of agency. As such, deities are more akin to a library of devices that can be accessed or otherwise
invoked with another device. These are called invocation devices and are often represented in some form of religious
worship or ritual.

Deities in Abseta are often viewed as sources of power. While some religions will impose agency and personality onto the
devices that make up a deity, the reality is that the devices have no feelings or desires and only encapsulate
functionality to be maintained and accessed. This means that followers of a deity will never have a conversation with
them. Deities "express" their presence and expose their power through religious invocation of their followers.

### Historical Deities

### Current Era Deities

### The Decay

Due to the volatility of the substrate, many deities throughout history have been reclaimed. In religious circles this
inevitability is known as The Decay.

Deification requires a certain amount of stability in the devices that the deity exists in. Devices may contain
self-correcting functionality or an active base of worshipers may work tirelessly to maintain the deified devices.
Despite this, no worshiped deity has been able to indefinitely stave off inactivation due to the reclamation and
optimization functions of the substrate.
