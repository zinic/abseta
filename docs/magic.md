# Abseta Magic Supplement

Magic in Abseta is deeply arcane and logical. Practicing magic comes with significant danger to the agent and their
surroundings.

## The Danger

Devices in Abseta are terrifying constructs that bend the physical rules of the simulation. They are as logical as they
are deadly. Runaway devices are a constant thread throughout history and have been the cause of many great catastrophes.

The many cultures of Abseta are fully aware of the danger of devices, leading many to create very stringent or often
adversarial rules for those that manipulate the substrate.

## The Gift

Magic in Abseta is known by several, different names that have slightly different meanings: devices, scripts and
schematics. All magic, regardless of complexity is often colloquially referred to as just a device.

The ability to create devices requires a complex command of logic and deep mental discipline. Of the available
population of agents in Abseta, roughly `0.5%` are capable of learning the skills required to manipulate the substrate.

### Devices

> A conjured flame is just as much a device as the great firestorms that conductors once wielded.

Devices are the fundamental construct that drives magic in Abseta. Devices manifest as subtle changes in the state of
the simulation and exist ephemerally inside the substrate. Given the right conditions, devices can be used to subvert
the physical bounds of the simulation. While "magic" itself is a rarely used word in Abseta, the entire population is
otherwise aware of devices and their potential effects.

Put simply, a device is a physical pattern that elicits a side effect from the substrate that circumvents the physical
rules of the simulation. Devices are the most common form of substrate manipulation. Many devices are simple enough to
invoke with the correct execution of somatic, metal, verbal or ritualistic components.

### Scripts

Scripts are a higher level representation of devices that can be stored physically. The storage requirements of a script
scales exponentially with its complexity. There is no way to circumvent the storage requirements of a script.

### Schemas

A schema is a collection of scripts that interoperate to evoke intricately complex or large scale devices. Schematics
are almost always encoded physically.

There may be one or two agents in the whole of Abseta that could subsume an entire schema inside their mind.

### Agent Limitations

> You can't keep everything in your head.

All agents present in the substrate inherit a set of limitations imposed by the creators of the simulation. These
limitations are not well understood except for the most obvious which is that few if any living agents can create and
invoke large scale, highly complex devices without physically storing the script of the device. This is due to the
scale of complexity and therefore storage that such devices require.

* Novice or otherwise inexperienced agents that work to manipulate the substrate are called `operators`.
* Agents that are capable of authoring scripts are called `controllers`.
* Highly experienced and disciplined agents capable of authoring entire schematics by themselves are known
  as `conductors`.

## The Substrate

> The ground beneath your feet is alive in more ways than you could ever imagine.

Magic pulls from the substrate to bend the rules of the simulation. The substrate is a simulation subsystem built from
complex API surfaces. The substrate is redundant and fault-tolerant.

## The Hypervisor

> Even a safety net has holes in it.

The hypervisor is a distinct, higher level component of the substrate that maintains and monitors the running state of
the simulation. If defects arise in the simulation the hypervisor corrects the state of the simulation. The goal of the
hypervisor is to perform as little work as possible when applying corrections. While this can result in some
non-optimal outcomes for simulation agents, the complexity of the hypervisor must not exceed the simulation itself.

The hypervisor has no agent or persona. It is as a part of the physical reality of the simulation as any other of its
physical rules.

While designed to be as minimal and simple as possible, the hypervisor, like the simulation, is still a running part of
the substrate. Strange, wide-scale unexpected conditions may reveal defects in the hypervisor's devices. The
consequences of encountering such a defect has never been recorded in the history of the simulation.

## Accessing the Substrate

> The universe is full of unintended consequences.

Subtle physical interactions may create conditions within the substrate called devices. The ability of agents to create
devices is likely a side effect of both how Abseta was created and the substrate it exists on. Agents may use these
devices to prepare states in the simulation which allow them to escape normal control flow of the substrate.

Unlike simpler systems that have no built-in fault-tolerant hypervisors, the substrate is both highly redundant and
resilient to total system failures. Runaway failures may cause significant changes or damage to Abseta itself but there
are no failure conditions that can fatally damage the simulation.

### Simulation Guardrails

> But there's always a backdoor.

The simulation is protected by a system called the hypervisor. Invisible to the simulation and its state, the hypervisor
is responsible for sustaining the execution of the simulation. The hypervisor can not be influenced or accessed by
agents or agent devices.

### Scale of Complexity

> Greater complexity leads to greater consequences.

Small devices often elicit small results. There are exceptions to this case however they all involve invoking already
prepared devices.

For example: an agent may have memorized a very specific thought pattern that they evoke with meaningless somatic or
verbal components. The specificity of these patterns may be enough to create a device.

Large devices require greater complexity. They may be composed of several smaller devices or encoded as one monolithic
device. Greater complexity often requires more time to encode and may involve writing scripts. Very few agents in Abseta
can conjure complex, intricate devices without storing the complexity of the device physically.

Unless fault-tolerant itself, most devices will not survive normal state changes that occur within the substrate.
Devices left unfinished may remain dangerous for some time. However, given enough time, the normal ebb and flow of the
substrate will render all unfinished or unused devices inoperable.

### Shifting Substrate

> The only constant in Abseta is change.

The substrate is not static. Devices that may have worked for hundreds of years can fail without explanation. Further
still, inoperable devices may become functional once more given enough time.

The average lifetime of a device however is normally measured in centuries.

### Substrate Optimizations

> If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound? Well, it depends.

The substrate does not compute all possibilities because it does not need to. The substrate has significant computing
resources at its disposal: it may perform bayesian updates all parameters of the simulation. However, this comes at an
equally significant energy expenditure to perform. As such, the substrate and simulation hypervisor

### Substrate Echos

> Death is just another state.

An agent that "dies" in the simulation may remain in the substrate in an ethereal capacity for centuries. Dead agents
exhibit many of the same properties as a complex device. As such, dead agents maybe manipulated or even reactivated by
devices.

The substrate does not garbage collect effectively. The simulation will retire certain inactive agents only when the
resources their presence consumes is required by the substrate. This is known as reclamation. There is no way to predict
when agents will be reclaimed however active agents can increase the likelihood of a reclamation occurring. This is
often done by creating and invoking enormous schematics.

The greater the rate of change in the simulation the less likely inactive agents will remain in simulation.
