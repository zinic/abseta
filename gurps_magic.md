## Casting Faster

The penalty is **-3 per halving of casting time** (round time up).

Reduction of casting time below one second is allowed for producing emergency blocking effects. These instant device
activations require the caster take any negatives from reducing the casting time of the device to **1 second** and then
apply an additional **-2**.

## Distractions

If you use an active defense against an attack, or are knocked back, knocked down, injured, grappled, or otherwise
distracted while concentrating, make a **Will roll at -3** to continue casting your device. On a failure, your device is
spoiled and you must start over.

If you are stunned while concentrating, your device is automatically spoiled.

If you are injured but not stunned while concentrating, and succeed on the roll to avoid distraction, you may cast your
device. However, the shock penalty for your injury reduces your effective skill. See Basic p. 419 for details on shock.

## Using Devices Concurrently

Using multiple devices at the same time incurs the following penalties:

* a **-3** per device you are concentrating on at the moment. See the individual device descriptions to learn which
  devices require concentration.
* a **-1** per other device you have at the moment. A device that lasts permanently (as indicated in the device
  description) does not carry a penalty.

## Extracting Energy Reserve from Targets

Meta + Transform

Drains up to 10 points from the target's combined HT and WIL.

* Extracted energy reserve may be used to pay off caster tally points.

## Maintaining Devices

If you can maintain a device, the energy cost to do so is given in its description, following the casting cost.

When the device reaches the end of its duration, you may continue the device by paying its maintenance cost. If you do,
the device continues for another interval equal to its duration. This takes no time and requires no skill roll. Distance
is not a factor.

## Device Modifiers

All device modifiers operate on the margin of success of casting a device. The charts and rules below will help you
determine the device effect's magnitudes.

### Personal Abilities

A successful casting at base energy cost with no skill modifier can add or remove attributes, secondary characteristics,
advantages, and disadvantages worth a total of 10 character points (positive or negative).

When using margin of success, each point of success adds or removes traits worth 10 character points, with a minimum
effect of 10 points. Hence, a strengthening effect that succeeds by 2 can raise the subject’s ST (and thus HP) by 2,
while a curse of stupidity that succeeds by 7 can lower his IQ (and with it, Per and Will) by 3.

#### Shaping Effects to Hit Locations

Much like attacks, device effects may target or omit a specific hit locations for a given penalty.

### Damage

Damage is defined in Thaum pg. 182 however the below chart can be used for most cases for margin:

| Margin | Damage |
|--------|--------|
| 0      | 1d-3   |
| 1      | 1d-2   |
| 2      | 1d     |
| 3      | 1d+1   |
| 4      | 2d     |
| 5      | 2d+1   |
| 6      | 3d     |
| 7      | 3d+1   |
| 8      | 4d     |
| 9      | 4d+1   |
| 10     | 5d     |
| 11     | 5d+1   |

#### Types

Device damage type may default to **crushing** or **burning** for no additional multiplier.

| Damage Type                                 | Multiplier |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Small Piercing                              | x0.5       |
| Burning, Crushing, Piercing, Toxic          | x1.0       |
| Cutting, Large Piercing, Explosive          | x1.5       |
| Corrosion, Fatigue, Huge Piercing, Impaling | x2.0       |

##### Examples

Applying a sing damage type:
12

```
Device damage of 2d requires margin 4.
A large piercing attack has a modifier of x1.5.

The required total margin for the damage and damage type is: 4 x 1.5 = 6.
```

Stacking multiple damage types:

```
Device damage of 4d+1 requires margin 9.
A corrosive attack has a modifier of x2.0.
An explosive attack has a modifier of x1.5.

The required total margin for the damage and stacked damage types is: 9 x 2.0 x 1.5 = 27.
```

### Multiple Targets

Applies to direct effects only. This is not a projectile multiplier.

| Margin | Targets |
|--------|---------|
| 0      | 1       |
| 2      | 2-3     |
| 4      | 4-5     |
| 6      | 6-7     |
| 8      | 8-10    |
| 10     | 11-14   |
| 12     | 15-20   |

### Range

Margin determines the available range of your device.

| Margin | Range      |
|--------|------------|
| 0      | Touch Only |
| 1      | 2 Yards    |
| 2      | 5 Yards    |
| 3      | 10 Yards   |
| 4      | 20 Yards   |
| 5      | 50 Yards   |
| 6      | 100 Yards  |
| 7      | 200 Yards  |
| 8      | 500 Yards  |
| 9      | 1000 Yards |

#### Notes

Melee, Missile and Blocking devices all have no range.


### Area of Effect

Area of effect is determined by margin and measured as the diameter of the effect.

| Margin | Area of Effect Diameter |
|--------|-------------------------|
| 0      | 2 Yards                 |
| 1      | 3 Yards                 |
| 2      | 5 Yards                 |
| 3      | 7 Yards                 |
| 4      | 10 Yards                |
| 5      | 15 Yards                |
| 6      | 20 Yards                |
| 7      | 30 Yards                |
| 8      | 50 Yards                |
| 9      | 70 Yards                |

### Duration

Duration is determined by margin. For margins greater than 10, the duration is effectively infinite.

| Margin | Duration    |
|--------|-------------|
| 0      | 1d6 Seconds |
| 1      | 10 Minutes  |
| 2      | 1 Hour      |
| 3      | 12 Hours    |
| 4      | 1 Day       |
| 5      | 1 Week      |
| 6      | 2 Weeks     |
| 7      | 1 Month     |
| 8      | 3 Months    |
| 9      | 1 year      |
| 10     | 3 Years     |

### Lifting Weight

Lifting strength of devices is determined by margin:

| Margin | Weight Limit |
|--------|--------------|
| 0      | 10 lbs       |
| 1      | 30 lbs       |
| 2      | 100 lbs      |
| 3      | 300 lbs      |
| 4      | 1,000 lbs    |
| 5      | 3,000 lbs    |
| 6      | 5 tons       |
| 7      | 15 tons      |
| 8      | 50 tons      |
| 9      | 150 tons     |
