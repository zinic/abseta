# Magic Rules Supplement

## Casting Faster

The penalty is **-3 per halving of casting time** (round time up).

Reduction of casting time below one second is allowed for producing emergency blocking effects. These instant device activations require the caster take any negatives from reducing the casting time of the device to **1 second** and then apply an additiona **-2**.

## Distractions

If you use an active defense against an attack, or are knocked back, knocked down, injured, grappled, or otherwise distracted while concentrating, make a **Will roll at -3** to continue casting your device. On a failure, your device is spoiled and you must start over.

If you are stunned while concentrating, your device is automatically spoiled.

If you are injured but not stunned while concentrating, and succeed on the roll to avoid distraction, you may cast your device. However, the shock penalty for your injury reduces your effective skill. See Basic p. 419 for details on shock.

## Using Devices Concurrently

Using multiple devices at the same time incurs the following penalties:

* a **-3** per device you are concentrating on at the moment. See the individual device descriptions to learn which devices require concentration.
* a **-1** per other device you have at the moment. A device that lasts permanently (as indicated in the device description) does not carry a penalty.

## Maintaining Devices

If you can maintain a device, the energy cost to do so is given in its description, following the casting cost.

When the device reaches the end of its duration, you may continue the device by paying its maintenance cost. If you do, the device continues for another interval equal to its duration. This takes no time and requires no skill roll. Distance is not a factor.

## Device Modifiers

All device modifiers operate on the margin of success of casting a device. The charts and rules below will help you determine the device effect's magnitudes.

### Damage

Damage is defined in Thaum pg. 182 however the below chart can be used for most cases for margin:

| Margin | Damage |
|--------|--------|
| 0 | 1d-3 |
| 1 | 1d-2 |
| 2 | 1d |
| 3 | 1d+1 |
| 4 | 2d |
| 5 | 2d+1 |
| 6 | 3d |
| 7 | 3d+1 |
| 8 | 4d |
| 9 | 4d+1 |
| 10 | 5d |
| 11 | 5d+1 |

#### Types

Device damage type may default to **crushing** or **burning** for no additional multiplier.

| Damage Type | Multiplier |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Small Piercing | x0.5 |
| Burning, Crushing, Piercing, Toxic | x1.0 |
| Cutting, Large Piercing, Explosive | x1.5 |
| Corrosion, Fatigue, Huge Piercing, Impaling | x2.0 |

##### Examples

Applying a sing damage type:

```
Device damage of 2d requires margin 4.
A large piercing attack has a modifier of x1.5.



The required total margin for the damage and damage type is: 4 x 1.5 = 6.
```

Stacking multiple damage types:

```
Device damage of 4d+1 requires margin 9.
A corrosive attack has a modifier of x2.0.
An explosive attack has a modifier of x1.5.



The required total margin for the damage and stacked damage types is: 9 x 2.0 x 1.5 = 27.
```

### Multiple Targets

Applies to direct effects only. This is not a projectile multiplier.

| Margin | Targets |
|--------|---------|
| 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 2-3 |
| 4 | 4-5 |
| 6 | 6-7 |
| 8 | 8-10 |
| 10 | 11-14 |
| 12 | 15-20 |

### Range

Margin determines the available range of your device.

| Margin | Range |
|--------|------------|
| 0 | Touch Only |
| 1 | 2 Yards |
| 2 | 5 Yards |
| 3 | 10 Yards |
| 4 | 20 Yards |
| 5 | 50 Yards |
| 6 | 100 Yards |
| 7 | 200 Yards |
| 8 | 500 Yards |
| 9 | 1000 Yards |

#### Notes

Melee, Missile and Blocking devices all have no range.

### Area of Effect

Area of effect is determined by margin and measured as the diameter of the effect.

| Margin | Area of Effect Diameter |
|--------|-------------------------|
| 0 | 2 Yards |
| 1 | 3 Yards |
| 2 | 5 Yards |
| 3 | 7 Yards |
| 4 | 10 Yards |
| 5 | 15 Yards |
| 6 | 20 Yards |
| 7 | 30 Yards |
| 8 | 50 Yards |
| 9 | 70 Yards |

### Duration

Duration is determined by margin. For margins greater than 10, the duration is effectively infinite.

| Margin | Duration |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 1d6 Seconds |
| 1 | 10 Minutes |
| 2 | 1 Hour |
| 3 | 1 Day |
| 4 | 1 Week |
| 5 | 1 Month |
| 6 | 1 Year |
| 7 | 10 Years |
| 8 | 20 Years |
| 9 | 100 Years |
| 10 | 1,000 Years |

### Lifting Weight

Lifting strength of devices is determined by margin:


| Margin | Weight Limit |
|--------|--------------|
| 0 | 10 lbs |
| 1 | 30 lbs |
| 2 | 100 lbs |
| 3 | 300 lbs |
| 4 | 1,000 lbs |
| 5 | 3,000 lbs |
| 6 | 5 tons |
| 7 | 15 tons |
| 8 | 50 tons |
| 9 | 150 tons |
